# CTA - Console tasks automation
## I´m trying to make something like a kind of small programming language.
It gets interpreted by Python scripts and should become a mixture of C# and Python.
It´ll be usefull for small automation processes in the console and won´t allow to make GUIs. It will be able to do similar things as the cmd.
